# Notes on *An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R*

I obtained the PDF file of the book through my universities library, however, I am not allowed to disseminate it, myself.


## Introduction

This book is an introduction to statistical analysis written by some of the most influential statisticians of the current day.
This repository are my notes on the book.

The book has an accomanying package ['ISLR'](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ISLR) that contains some of the data sets used throughout.
